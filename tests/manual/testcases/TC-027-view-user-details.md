    # TC-027: User Management - View User Details

## Test Information
- **Test ID**: TC-027
- **Test Type**: Functional Test
- **Priority**: High
- **Author**: Test Engineer
- **Date Created**: 2025-08-25

## Test Objective
Verify that authenticated users can view detailed information for a specific user using the GET /users/{id} endpoint.

## Preconditions
- Backend server is running
- Frontend application is accessible
- User is logged in with valid credentials
- Target user exists in the system

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to User Details
1. Go to User Management page (`/users`)
2. Click "View" button for any user in the list
3. Verify redirect to `/users/{id}`

**Expected Result**: User detail page loads successfully

### Step 2: Verify User Information Display
1. Check that user details are displayed:
   - User ID
   - Full name
   - Email address
   - User role (badge)
   - Creation date
   - Last updated date
2. Verify user avatar/icon is displayed

**Expected Result**: All user information is displayed correctly

### Step 3: Test Action Buttons
1. Verify "Edit User" button is present
2. Verify "Delete User" button is present (if not current user)
3. Verify "Back to users" link works

**Expected Result**: All action buttons are functional

### Step 4: Test Direct URL Access
1. Navigate directly to `/users/{valid_id}`
2. Verify page loads correctly
3. Test with invalid ID `/users/99999`

**Expected Result**: Valid ID shows user, invalid ID shows error

## Test Data
- Valid user ID: 1
- Invalid user ID: 99999
- Test user email: user@example.com

## Expected Results
- User detail page loads without errors
- All user information is displayed correctly
- Action buttons are present and functional
- GET /users/{id} API endpoint is called successfully
- Invalid IDs handle gracefully

## Pass/Fail Criteria
- **Pass**: User details display correctly and all functionality works
- **Fail**: Page doesn't load, information missing, or API call fails

## Notes
- This test validates the GET /users/{id} endpoint functionality
- Should handle both valid and invalid user IDs
- Tests detailed view functionality
